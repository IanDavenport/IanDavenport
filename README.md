### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Graduated from Code Nation's master coding bootcamp in Manchester at the end of November 2020.

Caught a very serious case of 'Imposter Syndrome' towards the end of my bootcamp which really knocked my confidence.  

After a break from coding, I'm starting to slowly build myself back up again by re-visiting class videos,reviewing 
online tutorials etc. 

I'm also learning iOS development and playing with small apps to begin with which will be commited to Git as soon as I'm able.


Thanks for stopping by.

Ian
