### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Graduated from Code Nation's master coding bootcamp in Manchester at the end of November 2020.

Caught a very serious case of 'Imposter Syndrome' towards the end of my bootcamp which really knocked my confidence.  

After a month's break from coding, I'm starting to slowly build myself back up again by re-visiting class videos and reviewing 
online tutorials and will resume with Git commits as soon as able.


Thanks for stopping by.

Ian
