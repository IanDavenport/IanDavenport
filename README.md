### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Graduated from Code Nation's master coding bootcamp in Manchester at the end of November 2020.

I had a bad case of 'Imposter Syndrome' towards the end of my bootcamp which really knocked my confidence in myself.  

After a break from coding, I took a three week course at Code Nation and really enjoyed learning again, enhancing my knowledge of HTML & CSS, plus learnt some Python too.

This set me off again and presently I'm enhancing my JavaScript knowledge on freeCodeCamp. 


Thanks for stopping by.

Ian
